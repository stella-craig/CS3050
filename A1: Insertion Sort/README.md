# Assignment 1: Implement Insertion Sort

You are to implement Insertion Sort as a function similar to the Standard C Library's qsort function. You are given a main() program, a Makefile, a library, 
and some starter code for your sorting function. All you need to do is complete the actual code for the function insertionsort() in the provided sort.c file.

Note: All starter code is provided by my professor Jim Ries (github.com/JimRies1966). I have only edited the sort.c file and so that is all I will be uploading 
to this repository but the starter code is available via the link in the attached pdf.

CS3050SP2023-A1.pdf - The instructions given from the instructor. This includes the starter code.

sort.c - The C file for the sorting functions.
